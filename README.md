# Vehicle Routing Problem

This repository contains my final project for CSCI 2951-O "Foundations of Prescriptive Analytics" an advanced graduate course I took in my sophmore spring (2022)
at Brown University.

The project focuses on a simplification of the Vehicle Routing Problem : Given a single depot and **n** customers who each have some demand , find close to optimal 
routes for **t** trucks to deliver the goods from the depot.

My solution uses a combination of Linear Programming and simulated annealing. The presentation pdf (in the repo) contains a bit more detail.
